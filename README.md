🎨 How to Customize Images

1. The Main Logo

File Name: logo.png

Instructions: Save your logo image as logo.png and place it in the folder. The code automatically looks for this specific filename.

Note: If the image is missing, it will fallback to displaying text "AJ.".

2. Hero Background (Top Section)

File Name: Untitled design (1).png

Instructions: Save your main background photo with this exact name, or open index.html in a text editor (like Notepad) and find line 337:

background-image: url('Untitled design (1).png');


Change 'Untitled design (1).png' to your actual file name (e.g., 'banner.jpg').

3. Portfolio Gallery

Instructions: Open index.html in a text editor and scroll down to the <section class="portfolio-section">.

Look for lines like this:

<img src="" class="placeholder-img" alt="Work 1">


Add your image filename inside the src="" quotes:

<img src="my-bride-photo.jpg" class="placeholder-img" alt="Bridal Work">
